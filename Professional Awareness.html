								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>I was employed to work on a game called "Golem Project" as part of my Professional Awareness module in Level 5 Computer Games Programming. As a Junior Game Developer, my role in the team was to develop an Endless Runner minigame for that project within a total timeframe of 2 months. This was my first time being employed (though this might be more a job simulation rather than actual employment) and I learned a lot from it.</p>
								<p>My hard work on my assigned duty resulted in a funcional base for an Endless Runner game, with features such as spawning in Level Segments and an item collection system. Level Segments are segments of the minigame, made of a base (the terrain) and the interactables (coins, obstacles, etc). Doing it this way made it possible to have continuous level parts as well as being able to randomise these segments to vary the layout of the level, so the player will have a new experience every time they play the game mode. Interactables currently consist of coins, that can be picked up to increase the in-game score, and obstacles, that cause a loss state upon collision between it and the player. I unfortunately did not manage to make the loss state on time, however I made sure to make it as easy as possible for whoever will work on this minigame next. I was also in charge of adding other features to the game, such as player movement and the aforementioned loss state, however I was not able to complete those due to multiple reasons.</p>
								<h2>What I learned</h2>
								<p>The main takeaways I gained from this project for myself were:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>I am more motivated and focused when I know other people are relying on me finishing my work.</li>
									<li>My main areas for improvement are time management and adaptability, as those were the main reasons for me failing to finish some of my work.</li>
								</ul>
